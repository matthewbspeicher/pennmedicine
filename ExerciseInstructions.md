Your objective is to implement Francis, a simple message responder that responds as follows:                                                                                                                                              
* Francis answers 'Sure.' if you ask him a question
* He answers 'Chill!' if you yell at him using all capital letters
* He says 'See if I care!' if you address him without actually saying anything
* He answers 'Whatevs.' to anything else

You may choose to implement Francis in either PHP 7 or Ruby 2.4. We have included a test suite in each of those languages which your implementation of Francis must pass without any alteration to the test suite.

If you don't have a working PHP + PHPUnit or Ruby environment available, you may wish to use this page as a starting point to get Ruby installed on your computer: https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/installation/.

Please complete this exercise, upload your solution as a *private* Gist on GitHub, and send us the URL.
